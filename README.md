# DifferentiableDavis1985

Reproducing particle distributions from Davis et al. (1985) "The Evolution of Large-Scale Structure in a Universe Dominated by Cold Dark Matter" using differentiable forward simulations.

## Goal

Reproduce the N-body simulation results from the seminal CDM paper (see `paper_material/paper.pdf`) using modern differentiable simulation techniques.

## Original Paper

Davis, M., Efstathiou, G., Frenk, C. S., & White, S. D. M. (1985)
ApJ, 292, 371-394

The paper presented simulations of gravitational clustering in cold dark matter dominated universes with 32,768 particles, demonstrating the formation of large-scale structure, filaments, and voids.
