# Optimization configuration
# Fast reconstruction for testing gradient-based optimization

# Number of particles per dimension
# (Not critical for reconstruction speed - mesh_shape is more important)
n_particles: 16

# Standard LCDM cosmology
omega_m: 0.3

# Initial scale factor (a=0.01 -> z=99)
a_init: 0.01

# Final scale factor (a=0.33 -> z~2)
# Using z=2 instead of z=0 for faster evolution (less non-linear)
a_final: 0.33

# Box size in comoving Mpc/h
box_size: 100.0

# Mesh cells per dimension for density field
# This is THE KEY parameter for optimization speed!
# mesh_shape^3 determines the size of the density field being optimized
# 12^3 = 1,728 cells → ~6-8 sec/iteration
# 16^3 = 4,096 cells → ~15-20 sec/iteration

# Minimum number of output snapshots for ODE integrator
# Keep at 2 for fastest reconstruction (just initial and final)
