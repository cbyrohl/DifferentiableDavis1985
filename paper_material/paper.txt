                                          We present the results of numerical simulations of nonlinear gravitational clustering in universes dominat-
                                       ed by weakly interacting, “ cold ” dark matter (e.g., axions or photinos). These studies employ a high resolution
                                       iV-body code with periodic boundary conditions and 32,768 particles; they can accurately represent the theo-
                                       retical initial conditions over a factor of 16 in length scale. We have followed the evolution of ensembles of
                                       models with Q = 1 and Del from the initial conditions predicted for a “ constant curvature ” primordial
                                       fluctuation spectrum. We also ran one model of a flat universe with a positive cosmological constant. Large
                                       filamentary structures, superclusters of clumps, and large low-density regions appear at certain times in all our
                                       simulations; however, we do not find large regions as extreme as the apparent void in Bootes. The evolution
                                       of the two-point correlation function, ^(r), is not self-similar; its effective power-law index becomes more nega-
                                       tive with time. Models with Q = 1 are inconsistent with observation if galaxies are assumed to be unbiased
                                       tracers of the underlying mass distribution. The peculiar velocities of galaxies are predicted to be much too
                                       large. In addition, at times when the shape of ^(r) matches that observed, the amplitude of clustering is
                                       inferred to be too small for any acceptable value of the Hubble constant. Better agreement is obtained for
                                       Q = 0.2, but in both cases the rms relative peculiar velocity of particle pairs decreases markedly with pair
                                       separation, whereas the corresponding quantity for galaxies is observed to increase slowly. In all models the
                                       three-point correlation function Ç is found to fit the observed form, Ç oc Q^2, but with Q depending weakly on
                                       scale. On small scales Q substantially exceeds its observed value. Consistent with this, the mass distribution of
                                       clusters is very broad, showing the presence of clumps with a very wide range in mass at any given time. The
                                       model with a positive cosmological constant closely resembles an open model with the same value of Q. If
                                       galaxies are a random sampling of the mass distribution, none of our models is fully consistent with observa-
                                       tion. An alternative hypothesis is that galaxies formed only at high peaks of the initial density field. The clus-
                                       tering properties of such “ galaxies ” are biased ; they appear preferentially in high-density regions and so are
                                       more correlated than the overall mass distribution. Their two- and three-point correlation functions and their
                                       relative peculiar velocity distribution may be consistent with observation even in a universe with Q = 1. If this
                                       is an appropriate model for galaxy formation, it may be possible to reconcile a flat universe with most aspects
                                       of the observed galaxy distribution.

                         EdSl-5 (shown as solid lines). The agreement at small wavenumber shows that the evolution of large-scale structure in the standard models has not been adversely
                         affected by the absence of wavelengths larger than the box size.

                         3 is such that as short-wavelength modes go nonlinear, they
                         grow more rapidly than the linear mode, resulting in a pro-
                         gressive flattening of the power spectra. The power spectra do
                         not evolve in a self-similar fashion.
                            A corresponding lack of self-similarity is shown by the evol-
                         ution of the two-point correlation function <^(r), which we plot
                         in Figure 4a for models EdSl-5. In order to achieve the highest
                         possible resolution, correlation functions were computed by
                         pair counts rather than by a Fourier transform of the power
                         spectrum; all pairs were used for log (r/L) < —1, and about
                         10% of pairs were used for larger separations. The effects of
                         force softening are apparent as a slight flattening of ^(r) on the
                         smallest scales shown [recall that log (rj/L) = —2.3],but gener-
                         ally the correlations have near power-law form on large scales.
                         Note that ^(r) steepens with time and has a power-law index
                         y = 1.8 at a = 1.8. By the end of the run y = 2.1, which is much
                         steeper than the observed galaxy function. Power law fits to £
                         over the range 30 > £ > 0.3 are given in Table 2 for all three of
                         our ensembles. In Figure 4a the growth of £(r) on large scale
                         matches the linear expectation, £ oc a2, while on small scale
                         [log (r/L) = —2.5], £ is growing as a2 2. This reflects the accel-
                         erated growth seen also in the power spectrum. As we discuss
                         in the next section, the nonlinear clustering in these models
                         does not match the predictions of earlier similarity arguments
                         (Peebles 1974,1980; Davis and Peebles 1977).

                         defined to be the integral part of log2 (Ng) + 1, where Ng is the number of particles in a group. It is thus equal to 1 for singles, to 2 for pairs, to 3 for triplets and
                         quadruples, and so on. Results are shown for a = 1.8 in (a) and for a = 3.0 in (b). In both plots filled squares give results for b = 0.25 and stars give results for b = 0.5,
